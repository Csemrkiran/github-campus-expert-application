# GitHub Campus Expert Application - Kiran
## Breaking Barriers in Tech Education Across Karnataka

---

## 🎯 My Vision
**Creating an inclusive GitHub community that bridges the gap between privilege and opportunity for students across Karnataka's 228+ colleges.**

As a final-year BCA student at MIT FGC and Sergeant at Arms for Rotaract Club, I've witnessed firsthand how systemic bias limits opportunities for students from non-engineering backgrounds. My mission is to establish GitHub Campus Expert as a catalyst for change, ensuring that every student—regardless of their stream or background—has access to world-class tech education and opportunities.

## 🏫 The Challenge at MIT FGC & Beyond

### Current Reality:
- **No functional tech clubs** despite existing registrations
- **Limited coding culture** in the college environment  
- **First-generation graduates** from villages with minimal tech exposure
- **Systemic bias** favoring engineering students in placements and opportunities
- **24 BCA colleges** under University of Mysore lacking unified tech communities

### The Bigger Picture:
University of Mysore oversees **[228 affiliated colleges](https://uni-mysore.ac.in/english-version/content.php?id=182)**, yet most tech opportunities, hackathons, and industry connections are concentrated in tier-1 engineering institutions, leaving thousands of talented BCA and BSc students without equal access to growth opportunities.

> **Impact Scale**: With 24 BCA colleges alone under University of Mysore, we're looking at potentially **5,000+ BCA students** who could benefit from inclusive GitHub education and community building.
